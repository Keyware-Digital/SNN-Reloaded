About the mod:
--------------

If you are the kind of guy that hates the type of mod which changes Nazi Zombie Gameplay completely, and you just want a mod to improve, fix and expand upon what Treyarch have already given us - this mod is for you! Shi No Numa Reloaded does exactly that! For a full detailed list of what my mod does, scroll down for more information.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mod Overview: (as of v2.03)
-------------

*Added 10 new fully working weapons to the mystery box!
*Added exclusive viewmodels to each character!
*Added a newly enhanced revive perk!
*Added new shiny main menu!
*Added respective pistols for each player. (including in second chance mode!)

*Type 99 (LMG)
*DP-28
*Bowie Knife
*Type 99 Sniper (New to Nazi Zombies - from me)
*SVT-40
*Mosin Rifle
*Nambu
*TT-33

*Refined the random box due to the new additions. 
*Removed Colt

*Removed G43
*Removed standard M1 Garand in favour for the M1 Garand w/ launcher.

*Added "pain sounds" to our four favourite characters.
-They will actually grunt now when they are hit by a zombie!

*Completely reworked a about half of the normal weapons.
*Shi No Numa used about half of it's weapon stats from the Single Player campaign where as Der Riese used it's own specifically balanced ones for every weapon - for Zombies.
*So, I changed the other half of the weapons in Shi No Numa to match the ones in Der Riese - So go try em out for yourself! (A lot of weapons including, nades, betties, noob tubes, ammo counts, etc)

*Improved random box logic.
*Revamped Max Ammo so it works similar to Black Ops.
